            <h2>Jammu</h2>
            <p>Jammu, a region steeped in history and culture, stands proudly at the foothills of the Himalayas. While
                the picturesque landscapes and historical landmarks are popular attractions, it's the region's
                milk-based products that capture the hearts and palates of both locals and visitors. With its fertile
                lands and favorable climate, Jammu's dairy farms produce rich and creamy milk, which serves as the
                foundation for a variety of delightful products. Be it the velvety yogurts, aromatic paneer (cottage
                cheese), or the sweetened treats like kheer (rice pudding) and ras malai, every bite transports one to a
                world of creamy indulgence. These products are not just a testament to the region's culinary heritage
                but also a celebration of its agrarian roots. For anyone visiting Jammu or exploring its cuisine, the
                milk-based products offer a delicious and authentic experience, capturing the essence of the land
                and its traditions.</p>
