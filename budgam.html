            <h2>Budgam</h2>
            <p>Budgam, a picturesque district in the beautiful region of Jammu and Kashmir, is known for its delicious
                milk-based products. The district's lush green meadows and favorable climate make it an ideal place for
                dairy farming.

                Local farmers in Budgam lovingly care for their cows and buffaloes, ensuring they produce high-quality
                milk. This fresh milk is then used to create a variety of tasty dairy products like creamy yogurt, rich
                butter, and delightful cheese.

                Budgam's milk-based products are not only a source of nutrition but also a part of the local culture.
                Families often gather to enjoy these dairy delights, and they are an essential ingredient in many
                traditional Kashmiri dishes.

                When you visit Budgam, don't forget to taste their homemade yogurt, which is known for its exceptional
                taste and texture. Whether you enjoy these products on their own or as part of a mouthwatering recipe,
                Budgam's milk-based offerings are sure to leave your taste buds delighted.</p>
