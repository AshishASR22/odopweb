            <h2>Pulwama</h2>

                takes pride in its production of a wide variety of milk-based products.

                Pulwama's fertile lands and favorable climate make it an ideal place for dairy farming. Local farmers
                raise healthy cattle, and their milk is used to create an array of delicious dairy products. From
                creamy, fresh milk to delectable sweets like "Rogan Josh" and "Shufta," Pulwama's dairy industry
                thrives.

                One of the most beloved products is the famous Pulwama saffron-infused ice cream, known for its rich,
                aromatic flavor. The locals have mastered the art of making yogurt, butter, and cheese, all of which are
                used in traditional Kashmiri cuisine, adding a distinct taste to the dishes.

                Visitors to Pulwama can savor these dairy delights and experience the warmth of the region's
                hospitality. Pulwama's milk-based products not only satisfy the taste buds but also provide a glimpse
